Minimalism seems to be gaining in momentum and popularity as a function of living in a culture of excess. (I knew learning calculus would come in handy.)

##### Why? An excess of empty calories, empty houses, inflated egos and empty wallets, according to more than a few (citations pending).

#### Who's Minimalism For?

Anybody. To me, the word alludes to a return to one's values. So Minimalism is a misnomer in that it is not about doing with less, merely doing with what matters to you. And who doesn't want that?!

#### Love [Being Focused on What Matters to You] -- Hurts

> “It is a painful thing to say to oneself: by choosing one road I am turning my back on a thousand others. Everything is interesting; everything might be useful; everything attracts and charms a noble mind; but death is before us; mind and matter make their demands; willy-nilly we must submit and rest content as to things that time and wisdom deny us, with a glance of sympathy which is another act of our homage to the truth.”

> – Antonin Sertillanges, "The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods"

> “Every result that you desire is  
preceded by a process that is required  
to produce the result. When you  
define YOUR process and commit to it  
for an extended period of time, the  
results take care of themselves.” - Hal Elrod

#### Focus

> Practically speaking, if timesaving devices really saved time, there would be more time available to us now than ever before in history. But, strangely enough, we seem to have less time than even a few years ago. It's really great fun to go someplace where there are no timesaving devices because, when you do, you find that you have **_lots _of time.** Elsewhere, you're too busy working to pay for machines to save you time so you won't have to work so hard. -- [Benjamin Hoff, The Tao of Pooh, pg. 107-108.]

#### E. D. Klemke

> "An objective meaning - that is, one which is inherent within the universe or dependent upon external agencies - would, frankly, leave me cold. It would not be _mine_... I, for one, am _glad_ that the universe has no meaning, for thereby is _man all the more glorious_. I willingly accept the fact that external meaning is non-existent... for this leaves me free to _forge my own meaning_."
